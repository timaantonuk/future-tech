Welcome to the Future Tech multi-page website! This project is a fully adaptive, responsive, and cross-browser-friendly site. I utilized modern web development techniques to ensure the best user experience across devices and screen sizes.
The site is built using the BEM methodology for clear and reusable code structure, along with SASS in the SCSS dialect for styling. Additionally, JavaScript was implemented using a class-based modular approach to enhance interactivity and add custom animations/components. All styles are created with REM units for better adaptability compared to pixels.
